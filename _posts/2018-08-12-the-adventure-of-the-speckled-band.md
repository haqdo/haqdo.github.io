When I was seven years old, my mother took me to the beach for the first and only time. It was a hot, lethargic day, and the air felt thick like syrup. When I had grown bored of disturbing the starfish and barnacles in the shallow tide pools, I took to wandering along the beach cliffs. I must have walked for a long time, because each time I looked over my shoulder, my mother, dozing off on her deck chair, would greow smaller and smaller u. Until she was only the size of the nail on of my pinky finger. The further I walked, the thinner the strip of sand between the ocean and the cliff became, until I was knee-deep in the water, until I wathens belly-deep, waves sploshing onto my chest. Something tiny and red glimmered in the surf. A stone perhaps, or a button. I dipped my face into the water to see it better—, the this red stone—, and suddenly I was completely under; the only red I could see was the stinging of my eyes, my throat, my nose. A sharp panic seized my little heart: I was entirely alone. My mother couldn’t help me— my sleeping mother, she was onlyjust the size of the nail on of my pinky finger anyway, my sleeping mother. That was when a hermit crab crawled into my ear and never left.

In the years since, I know iIt has been growing inside my head ever since. I know this because […]. 

I know that some hermit crabs can grow 0.67 centimetres a year, which means it takes about 14 years for them to grow to the size of a human brain. The largest species of hermit crab, the coconut crab, can grow up to a metre long. They Coconut crabs may have eaten Amelia Earhart when her plane, a splayed red lobster, dove head-first into the Pacific. The adult coconut crab is one of the only species of hermit crab to not need a shell, protecting itself instead with a toughened exoskeleton. The young coconut crab, though, has the same soft abdomen as any other type of hermit crab, a flaccid coil of helpless, vulnerable flesh. It seeks shelter in the empty shells of dead gastropods and bivalves, coconuts, bottle caps, hollow stones, wood scraps, soda cans, the tip of its abdomen adapted specifically to clasp onto its new vessel: the columella of a snail shell perhaps, or the cerebellum of my brain. Sometimes shells are uninhabitable. Sometimes they are a death sentence, l. Like, for instance, a slippery plastic water bottle that a crab can crawl into but from which it can never crawl out. Hermit crabs are a morbid bunch: they are attracted to the scent of the rotting flesh of their own kind, to the prospect of an empty shell left behind. They seek homes in the graves of their kin. And they die and they die and they die.

The smallest hermit crab, Coenobita compressus, is only 12 millimetres long.

My grandmother makes the best seafood. When I was little we used to go to the aquarium together, an old concrete building, gauche and out of place in our landlocked town. We would walk through the corridors of fish tanks, her hand holding mine, her other pointing out which creatures were edible and which were not. The shrimp were. The hermit crabs, generally not. The ones in the aquarium were too small and not worth shelling to eat anyway. My grandmother never uses recipes of course, but I’ve written one down for you:

For a pound of shell-on shrimp, combine the following in a medium saucepan:
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
4 tablespoons water
6 to 7 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt

Add the shrimp. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking. When things start boiling, pay close attention to the shrimps’ eyes. They don’t have eyelids because they don’t need to. When those pairs of black, glassy beads become dull and matte, remove from the heat and serve.

I know that if you take a cranial drill and cut a perfect ring around my skull, you can could open it up just like removing the lid off of a pot. I know that when you do, you will find a hermit crab the size of a human brain inside, cooked to perfection, seasoned with fourteen years of my thoughts. My eyes will be dull and matte and unblinking.
